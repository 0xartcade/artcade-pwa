# 0xArtcade PWA
*The mobile companion for 0xArtcade where all gameplay will be experienced*

## Some Philosophy!
Generally, people play games for fun, while on the go, and whenever they can make time (ie, in the mornings, if you get what I'm laying down). A purely mobile gameplay experience aligns well with how we expect people to play the game and reaches a wider audience. Using PWA technology allows us to craft an app-like experience without a whole new tech stack.

We've also implemented this PWA to avoid deep linking to crypto wallets, and instead use a custom OTP system with our backend to allow users to link their mobile apps to their account. As we expand our systems to allow for more general login (email, social) in addition to the web3 login we already implemented, we expect this to be a welcome addition that helps attract a wider audience to art and NFTs. 

Leaving crypto interactions to the desktop site also optimizes crypto interactions to be batch executed and separated from gameplay. Again, we believe that this helps minimize friction from mobile crypto wallets and expands future use cases to those outside of crypto (and can onboard them nicely too).
